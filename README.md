# 7-11 Data for Thailand

For seamless (map) integration in your own application for the nearest 7/11 COD/pickup points.
Use a haversine formula to calculate the nearest 7/11 based on inputted customer address data, map-coordinates (lat,lng) are included in the dataset along with formatted addresses.

Your app will be able to pinpoint the nearest 7/11's to pick up/pay for the merchandise send without connecting to an external service, just like for instance the Apple store does it.

Happy coding!

It would be nice with some credits, but none is required.
