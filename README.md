# 7-11 Data for Thailand

For seamless (map) integration in your own application for the nearest 7/11 COD/pickup points.
Use a Haversine formula to calculate the nearest 7/11 based on your customer address data, map-coordinates (lat,lng) are included in the dataset along with formatted addresses.

Your app will be able to pinpoint the nearest 7/11's to pick up/pay for the merchandise send without connecting to an external service, just like for instance the Apple store does it.
